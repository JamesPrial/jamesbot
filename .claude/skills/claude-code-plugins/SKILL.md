# Claude Code Plugin

This skill provides all relevent documentation for Claude Code Plugins. Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. Install plugins from marketplaces to add pre-built commands, agents, hooks, Skills, and MCP servers, or create your own to automate your workflows. All relevent docs can be found in [References](.claude/skills/plugin/references/). Start with [Plugins](.claude/skills/plugin/references/plugins.md). Only read what you need. Come back if you need more.
